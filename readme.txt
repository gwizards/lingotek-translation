Lingotek Translation offers convenient cloud-based localization and translation WordPress.

== Description ==

Lingotek Translation simplifies the process of creating and maintaining your WordPress multilingual website. Features include machine, professional, and community translation solutions that ease the manual burden of launching in new markets while improving language consistency, cutting costs, and enabling you to deliver your brand to consumers abroad in the quickest and most effective way possible.

Make your WordPress website content truly multilingual. The power to translate is now inside WordPress!

= Customizable Translation Workflows =

WordPress administrators use Translation Profiles to categorize content by its relative value. You associate each content type with a Translation Profile, and the plugin carries out the appropriate workflow:

= Professional =

The plugin enables you to use your own translation agency or tap into Lingotek's marketplace of more than 5,000+ in-country translators. Don't have time to manage your own translation project? Let Lingotek take care of it for you. The plugin fully automates file transfer between Wordpress and Lingotek. You'll have full visibility into the translation process every step of the way. And once the translations are completed, they'll automatically download and publish to your website according to the preferences you've set.

= Community =

If you're looking to save money by avoiding professional translation, you can take the do-it-yourself approach and have your bilingual employees, partners and/or users perform translations right within Wordpress. The plugin integrates with and provides use of the Lingotek Workbench, a professional-grade text editor used for translating, reviewing, and post-editing multilingual content.

= Free Automatic =

Machine translation is an excellent option if you're on a tight budget, looking for near-instant results, and are okay with less-than-perfect quality. The plugin allows you to quickly and automatically translate your site by providing use of the commercial API for Microsoft Translator (the cost is covered by Lingotek for up to 100,000 words). Machine translations can be post-edited at any time using the Lingotek Workbench.

= Cloud-Based Translation Management System =

Need access to a enterprise level Translation Management System designed to work directly with Wordpress and other content management systems allowing you can get complete transparent access with all your translation projects? The cloud-based Lingotek Translation Management Systems helps your business access new markets and customers. Contact sales@lingotek.com for more information and pricing of these features.

= Benefits =

* Cost Savings
* Faster Translation Times
* Higher Quality
* Real-time Monitoring
* Eliminate the Copy/Paste Method of Translating
* Increased Involvement and Loyalty
* In-context Review

= Features =

Lingotek works in conjuction with the [Polylang](https://wordpress.org/plugins/polylang/) plugin (the plumbing to make WordPress multilingual ready) allowing you to create a bilingual or multilingual WordPress site. You write posts, pages, and create categories and post tags as usual, and then define the language for each of them.

* You can use as many languages as you want. RTL language scripts are supported. WordPress languages packs are automatically downloaded and updated.
* You can translate posts, pages, media, categories, post tags, menus, widgets...
* Custom post types, custom taxonomies, sticky posts and post formats, RSS feeds and all default WordPress widgets are supported.
* The language is either set by the content or by the language code in the url, or you can use one different subdomain or domain per language.
* Categories, post tags as well as some other metas are automatically copied when adding a new post or page translation.
* A customizable language switcher is provided as a widget or in the nav menu.
* The admin interface is of course multilingual too and each user can set the WordPress admin language in its profile.

== Installation ==

1. Make sure you have [Polylang](https://wordpress.org/plugins/polylang/) installed as it provides the framework for the Lingotek plugin.
1. Upload the `wp-lingotek` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
1. Activate the Lingotek plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in Wordpress.
1. Create a Lingotek account by going to the `Translation` menu that appears in your admin menu.

== Screenshots ==

1. The translation dashboard allows you to view your site languages, add and remove new languages, check the overall translation progress of your site, and see site analytics.
2. Polylang and Lingotek work together seamlessly. Continue to use Polylang for content that you want to translate inside WordPress, while sending other content to be translated by Lingotek. The orange icons indicate Lingotek statuses/actions while the blue icons continue to represent Polylang actions.
3. Use translation profiles. One of the most time-consuming activities of any multilingual web-site project is managing the ongoing flow of changes and additions to site content and configurations. Translation profiles were created to allow you to create and save and re-use your translation settings.
4. Content type profiles. Manually choosing which content to upload and download is rarely what a content administrator wants to do, and automating the upload of every change is not workable because there are various types of content. Each type of translatable content can be assigned to a customizable profile. For example, by default, we like to have Posts use an Automatic profile so that content will automatically be uploaded for translation and the resulting translations automatically be downloaded back into WordPress.
